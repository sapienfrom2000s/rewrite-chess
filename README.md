Use w-s-a-d to move and 'enter' to select and move pieces

Use of 'coordinates' and 'squares' are synonymous. For display
squares has been used and in other places coordinates have
been used. However, this is not very black and white, 'squares'
might have been used at places where it fits in more appropriately
than 'coordinates'.

This project is inspired by Haseeb Qureshi's version of chess
